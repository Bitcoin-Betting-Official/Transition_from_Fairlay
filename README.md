# Transition from Fairlay to Bitcoin Betting

Fairlay will soon  transition to the new decentralized version of the Bitcoin Prediction Market called Bitcoin Betting. The company behind Fairlay will cease to exist and with it all centralized infrastructure like servers, hot wallets, funds, emails and so forth. We are currently prioritizing new users and those who have low or mid-sized betting amounts for onboarding. 


## New unified way to fund your Fairlay and Bitcoin Betting Account with Bitcoin

The Priority Wallet at Fairlay will remain available for withdrawals.   

Direct deposits to Fairlay will continue to be possible via www.bitcoin-betting.com/deposit. This form will lead you to an instance of BTCPayServer on www.bitcoin-betting.org to process your deposit.  

For every deposit you need to generate a new deposit address. Do not reuse addresses!

### Bridge from Fairlay

~~During the transition period funds can be easily bridged from Fairlay by sending a certain mBTC amount to the Fairlay user "bridge".~~
~~You must indicate your Bitcoin Betting user id  in the reference field (and nothing else).  So for example  15. Do not write "15" or 'user 15' or anything further or the transaction will fail.  Test with small amounts first.~~
~~The bridge is free of any charge.~~

### Withdraw mBTC from Bitcoin Betting to Fairlay

~~You can send mBTC back by making a transfer to user 1. Do not send mETH, rBTC, mWBTC.  You must reference your Fairlay user API ID in the reference field. Fairlay user id can be found in your Profile section. For example: 1016024. Do not write anything further.~~

It is recommended to use RBTC as main betting currency. You will have all the same features available that you enjoyed with BTC - including fast BTC deposits and instant withdrawals receivable in BTC or RBTC.  

### Direct BTC Deposits:

~~BTC Deposits to Bitcoin Betting are possibe via www.bitcoin-betting.com/deposit. If you choose RBTC as betting currency, all your funds are held in a smart contract. When you choose BTC, your funds will be stored in the Fairlay cold wallet.~~
It is recommended to use the BTC deposit option in the App. That way you will always have you BTC stored in a trustless manner in RBTC in a smart contract.

## Why is the change necessary?

Uncertainty in the different regulatory environments in the many jurisdictions we want to serve is the key reason making this step necessary. Furthermore, a decentralized network makes us more resilient against DDoS attacks, server outages and many other threats.
The high costs of maintaining our centralized server infrastructure, hosting the website, maintaining a hot wallet and so on will not allow us to keep the old site running for much longer than March 2025.   

## What is getting better?

### No collection of personal data, completely pseudonymous

No collection of private user data like email, name or passport will ever be required. Your entire identity is managed by your crypto currency wallet like MetaMask, WalletConnect or similar.  

### Speed

The new platform is heavily utilizing WebSockets and subscriptions. Thus the speed and update frequency will be much better than before.  Slow server response times, server errors or DDoS attacks will be a thing of the past. The official frontend runs entirely in your local browser and will be available on IPFS. With it you can connect to one of many available nodes.

### Simpler UI

The improved UI is designed to address less advanced users who always had problems with an exchange interface.  Nevertheless all the functionality that you know from the old site and more will continue to be available via the API, that each node is offering by default.

### New Users and Referral Program

With the release it will be again possible to invite new users. We actively encourage you to use this feature and invite all friends, co-workers and family members that take an interest in trading and betting.  The platform will only be available via invite to keep scammers, match fixers, money launderers and other bad actors out.  You will receive 10% of all generated commissions of any user you invite and also of any subsequent user that is referred.

### Full Transparency 

All Transactions are publicly available for anyone to check and verify.  
A very simple proof of concept for a public block explorer can be found here.  It is in alpha status: http://bitcoin-betting.org:3793/

### Security

Each transaction, let it be a transfer or a bet or a settlement must be signed with the private key that is only held by the respective user. It is impossible for anyone to steal any of your funds. Thus on the platform, there are no admins with special rights that can arbitrarily take or freeze funds. 

### Faster Deposits

The platform will allow transactions in any currency.  From inception BTC, WBTC and ETH will be available. Making deposits via ETH or WBTC can be performed in a trustless manner by using a decentralized so called bridge, a special contract on the Ethereum Blockchain. Such deposits will be available in less than a minute.

## What is getting worse?

### No Privacy

By design, any transaction is open to the public. 

### Signing

Each Transaction has to be signed before it can be transfmitted, making a bit more cumbersome to place a bet. There will probably be stand-alone applications where you only have to enter your private key once and the signing 
is done by the application itself. You may contact us to signal demand, if you want access to such an application.

### No transaction reversal

Bad Actors can no longer be easily stopped. 

### Miner Fees

Each Transaction that is mined to the decentralized ledger like any bet or transfer involves a small fee that is going to the Node that mines this transaction. The usual transaction costs is not more than 1 satoshi per transaction. Always make sure to keep a tiny amount of WBTC or BTC in your wallet to cover these fees.
