# Transition from Fairlay to Bitcoin Betting

Fairlay will soon  transition to the new decentralized version of the Bitcoin Prediction Market called Bitcoin Betting. The company behind Fairlay will cease to exist and with it all centralized infrastructure like servers, hot wallets, funds, emails and so forth. 

## Why is the change necessary?

Uncertainty in the different regulatory environments in the many jurisdictions we want to serve are the key reason for making this step necessary. Furthermore a decentralized network makes us more resilient against DDoS Attacks, server outages and many other attacks.
The rather high costs of maintaining our centralized server infrastructure, hosting the website, maintaining a hot wallet and so on will not allow us to keep the old site running for much longer than March 2025.   

## What is getting better?

### No collection of personal data, completely pseudonymous

No collection of private user data like Email, Name or ID-Card will ever be required. The entire identity is managed by your Crypto Currency Wallet like MetaMask, WalletConnect or similar.  

### Speed

The new platform is heavily utilizing WebSockets and subscriptions. Thus the speed and update frequency will be much better than before.  Slow server response times, server errors or DDoS attacks will be a thing of the past. The official frontend runs entirely in your local browser and will be available on IPFS. With it you can connect to one of many available nodes.

### Simpler UI

The improved UI is designed to address less advanced users who always had problems with an exchange interface.  Nevertheless all the functionality that you know from the old site and more will continue to be available via the API, that each node is offering by default.

### New Users and Referral Program

With the release it will be again possible to invite new users. We actively encourage you to use this feature and invite all friends, co-workers and family members that take an interest in trading and betting.  The platform will only be available via invite to keep scammers, match fixers, money launderers and other bad actors out. 

### Full Transparency 

All Transactions are publicly available for anyone to check and verify. 

### Security

Each transaction, let it be a transfer or a bet or a settlement must be signed with the private key that is only held by the respective user. It is impossible for anyone to steal any of your funds. Thus on the platform, there are no admins with special rights that can arbitrarily take or freeze funds. 

### Faster Deposits

The platform will allow transactions in any Currency.  From inception BTC, WBTC and ETH will be available. Making deposits via ETH or WBTC can be performed in a trustless manner by using a decentralized so called bridge, a special contract on the Ethereum Blockchain. Such deposits will be available in less than a minute.

## What is getting worse?

### No Privacy

By design, any transaction is open to the public. 

### Signing

Each Transaction has to be signed before it can be transfmitted, making a bit more cumbersome to place a bet.

### No transaction reversal

Bad Actors can no longer be easily stopped. 


## How to participate

The platform is fully governed by the Bitcoin Betting DAO.  All protocol and UI changes are decided by the DAO. Furthermore the DAO will hold all fees and commissions that are ever collected. 
Proposals can be initiated via https://app.aragon.org/#/daos/ethereum/bitcoin-betting.dao.eth/dashboard  !

But reports and any feature proposal that is accepted by the DAO will usually be rewarded directly by sending WBTC to the Ethereum address of the initiator of the proposal.

A governance forum is planned, for now it should be sufficient to discuss matters in the Chat on app.bitcoin-betting.com.

It should also be possible to trade ownership tokens of Bitcoin-Betting: bbet tokens (Contract address 0x60b8b2bf009a90d3864068bff2c2cb37d86b12ec).   There exist a maximum of 1 million bbet tokens that represent full ownership of all source code, IP, domains and funds associated with Bitcoin Betting.

These tokens can be traded on any decentralized platform, for example uniswap. 

New Proposals and updates from the DAO will also be published on https://x.com/_bitcoinbetting.

## Incentives to switch

On Fairlay a fee bomb was implemented. Commissions for newly created markets will rise by 0.01% each two weeks.  This is to incentivize a slow but steady transition to the new platform.
